# SparseConvNet
## A spatially-sparse convolutional neural network

SparseConvNet has *moved* to [https://github.com/facebookresearch/SparseConvNet](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SparseConvNet)

Now integrated with [Torch](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html) and [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), and with *submanifold* convolutions.
